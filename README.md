Thoughts and ideas i hope to bring to life

Hello I'm Sean McIntosh. My work revolves around people/users who need to get from A: problem to B: solution, businesses who want to help them solve this problem and the design that facilitates the relationship between the two.

Ideas for personal projects...

- Living Style guide(s)
  -/Using SASS
